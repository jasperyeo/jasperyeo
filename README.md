# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Singapore-based multimedia designer and developer, a balanced combination of creative and technical qualities. I specialise in bridging the gap between designers and programmers, covering all areas and layers of media and software development.

Throughout my entire tertiary education and career, I had been part of both small and big teams, creating rich user experiences through various aspects of design and development. Highly adaptable to the latest technologies and design trends, I can provide insights to facilitate better decisions for the team and company.

While not at work, I read and swim. Accomplished lifeguard, diver, and food lover.

I can be reached either through this profile, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yeoenghaijasper/), or by email at jasper.yeo.media@gmail.com.
